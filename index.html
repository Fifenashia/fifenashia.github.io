                <p>
                    I’m a Social Work Supervisor transitioning into web development through CODE:YOU. 
                    I learn by building projects that prioritize clarity, accessibility, and real-world usefulness. 
                    I’m especially interested in creating apps and tools that support families, community resources, 
                    and everyday organization. I joined the August CODE:YOU cohort and am excited to design projects 
                    that support both my current role and my future in tech.
